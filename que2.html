        CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental component of web development that plays a crucial role in designing and styling web pages. It provides a powerful and flexible way to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. With CSS, developers can transform a plain HTML document into a visually appealing and engaging website. CSS operates on a set of rules that define how elements should be presented. These rules consist of selectors, which target specific HTML elements, and declarations, which specify the desired styles for those elements. CSS offers a wide range of properties and values that allow developers to manipulate elements' color, size, font, spacing, positioning, and more. One of the key advantages of CSS is its ability to separate the content and structure of a web page from its presentation. By storing the style information in a separate CSS file or within the HTML document's style tag, developers can make changes to the appearance of an entire website or multiple pages simultaneously by modifying a single file.
